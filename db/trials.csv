21,"Memantine and Comprehensive, Individualized Management of Alzheimer's Disease and Caregiver Training","Presently some 4.5 million people are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in the United States. At present pharmacologic treatment, although beneficial, is not curative. Certain nonpharmacologic treatments have assisted caregivers of AD patients by reducing their stress and burden, and others have aided patients, by improving their mood and physical functioning. Comprehensive, individualized approaches to improving Alzheimer's patients' symptomatology and caregiver stress and burden have not been systematically investigated in Alzheimer's patient care. This study seeks to train and counsel caregivers as well as develop an individualized, comprehensive management program that will seek to enhance the functioning of each patient participant.
Patients are randomly placed into one of two groups. Both groups receive memantine and comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 4, 12,28 and 52 weeks. Additionally, group 1 receives an individualized management program, which consists of home visits to get the patient exercising, doing enjoyable activities and cognitive stimulation, educational sessions for caregivers on coping with difficult situations and a caregiver support group to help with questions and emotional concerns.","13001 East 17th Place, Aurora, CO, United States",2015-11-25,2016-03-31,,,17,2015-03-30 01:03:49.296535,2015-03-30 01:03:49.296535,,overboard@ucaurora.com,Joanna Stayton,t,-104.8377105,39.7451972
22,"A Single Site, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trial of NIC5-15 in Subjects With Alzheimer's Disease","Recent epidemiologic evidence, has suggested that diabetes mellitus significantly increases risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular risk factors. Moreover, even patients who are simply insulin resistant, without frank diabetes, have been shown to share this elevated risk for the development of AD. As insulin's role as a neuromodulator in the brain has been revealed, several potential mechanisms for the interaction of diabetes or insulin resistance with AD have been suggested such as decreased cortical glucose utilization particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; increased oxidative stress through the formation of advanced glycation end products; increased Tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation; and increased beta-amyloid aggregation through inhibition of insulin-degrading enzyme. The future treatment of AD might involve pharmacologic and dietary manipulations of insulin and glucose regulation
NIC5-15 is a single, small, naturally occurring molecule. Animal studies and some human trials have shown NIC5-15 to be safe and a potent insulin sensitizer at doses equivalent to 800-2000mg per day. In preclinical studies at doses higher than those previously studied in clinical trials, we found that NIC5-15 interferes with the accumulation of beta amyloid, an important step in the development of Alzheimer's pathology. These data suggest that NIC5-15 may be a reasonable therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer Disease for two reasons:
It is a -secretase inhibitor that is Notch-sparing. It is potentially an insulin-sensitizer.
However critical safety and human efficacy studies must be conducted. This application proposes to conduct these early critical human studies. The goal of the studies contained in this proposal is to establish safety and efficacy of NIC5-15 for the treatment of AD. The specific objectives of this study are to:
Specific Objective #1) Conduct a multiple dose safety study of NIC5-15 to establish safety in the doses that appear to block amyloid accumulation. These studies will characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability
This objective was met with completion of the initial study ID#NCT00470418.
The current study continues investigations of NIC5-15 in Alzheimer's disease with the following objective:
Specific Objective #2) Conduct a double blind placebo controlled pilot efficacy study of NIC5-15 in patients with AD. The goals of this study are to:
A) Demonstrate feasibility for a multi-site trial that will be used to guide the design of a future larger effort. Demonstration of feasibility will include examination of accrual rate, overall recruitment, adherence to protocol, compliance with medication and willingness to complete a randomized trial, and lack of short term toxicity.
B) Collect preliminary evidence of efficacy in terms of cognitive and global measures as well as secondary efficacy outcomes of activities of daily living, behavioral disturbances and AD biomarkers.","13001 East 17th Place, Aurora, CO, United States",2015-10-22,2015-12-31,,,17,2015-03-30 01:06:06.209076,2015-03-30 01:06:06.209076,,overboard@ucaurora.com,Dr. Joanna Stayton,t,-104.8377105,39.7451972

25,Omental Transposition Surgery for Mild Alzheimer's Disease,"The experimental procedure to be performed is omental transposition surgery, during which a general surgeon and a neurosurgeon work as a team to transpose a pedicle omental graft to the surface of the brain. The general surgeon is responsible for performing a laparotomy/laparoscopy, elongating the omentum into a long pedicle and developing an extensive subcutaneous tunnel up the chest and neck to the head. The neurosurgeon is responsible for performing the craniotomy and securing the omentum on the brain.
Creating an intact omental pedicled flap requires the services of a general surgeon and neurosurgeon. The first step in the operation is to obtain access to the abdominal cavity laparoscopically using four 5cm trocars, or via laparotomy through an upper midline incision. The omentum is then removed from the transverse colon, after which it is separated from its proximal and central attachments to the stomach. The omentum detachments are made directly on the greater curvature of the stomach, leaving the gastroepiploic arteries and veins within the still-connected omentum apron.
Final separation of the omentum from the proximal portion of the stomach is done by dividing the left gastroepiploic vessels, which at the highest proximal level on the stomach become the short gastric vessels. The vascular connections to and from the omentum are now maintained solely from the right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels. In order for the omental pedicle graft to reach the brain without tension, further surgical tailoring of the omentum is carried out, with care being taken to ensure the preservation of a major omental artery and vein.
After the omentum has been lengthened to an appropriate extent to reach the head, several small (3- to 4-inch) transverse incisions are made on the chest wall slightly lateral to the midline, with the side of the midline to make the transverse incisions depending on which cerebral hemisphere the omentum is to be placed. These transverse incisions are connected subcutaneously, thus creating a tunnel that begins at the upper pole of the midline abdominal incision and travels subcutaneously, up the chest wall and neck to behind the ear.","13001 East 17th Place, Aurora, CO, United States",2016-01-27,2016-02-04,,,17,2015-03-30 01:12:59.817454,2015-03-30 01:12:59.817454,,overboard@ucaurora.com,Dr. Joanna Stayton,t,-104.8377105,39.7451972

CERE-110 is an experimental drug that is designed to help nerve cells in the brain function better. CERE-110 uses a virus to transfer a gene that makes Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a protein that may make nerve cells in the brain healthier and protect them from dying. The virus used in CERE-110 does not cause disease in people. CERE-110 has been carefully studied in laboratory animals and is in the early stages of being tested in people.
Fifty patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will participate in this study.

29,"Effects of LY450139, on the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease as Compared With Placebo (IDENTITY-2)","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta amyloid (β-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) lowers the production of β-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional γ-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower β-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both β-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some patients. The buildup of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some patients. In this trial, patients who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all patients could eventually receive active drug. Each patient's participation could last approximately 2 years. Patients taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All patients who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open label study.
Preliminary results from this study (LFBC) (and another similar study LFAN [NCT00594568]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. LFBC, LFAN and open label LFBF (NCT01035138) have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least seven months.

31,Early-onset and Late-onset Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD),"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually associated with aging, age being the principal identified risk factor. However, younger subjects also develop AD and the prevalence of early onset AD is unknown. It is estimated that about 30 000 subjects develop symptoms of AD before the age of 65 in France. There is evidence that early onset AD differs from AD in older patients. In particular, clinical and neuroimaging studies suggest early involvement of neocortical brain regions and their functions in early onset AD, while mediotemporal areas and memory might be more involved in late onset AD. These differences could partly explain the atypical clinical and imaging features of younger patients, the diagnostic difficulties in these patients and the specific problems related to medical care of this age group. The present study uses a multidisciplinary approach with longitudinal followup in order to establish the impact of age on the clinical and neuroimaging picture of sporadic AD in a multicentric setting. Another aim of the project is to describe for each age group, and in particular for the younger patient group, the functional impact of disability in everyday life on both, patients and caregivers.","757 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States",2015-10-01,2015-12-31,,,26,2015-03-30 01:31:22.529734,2015-03-30 01:31:22.529734,,imoscar@ucla.com,Dr. Oscar Bluth,t,-118.4457428,34.0661172
32,Resveratrol for Alzheimer's Disease,"Resveratrol is derived from plants and is found in highest levels in red wine and the skin of red grapes. A recent study reported that monthly and weekly consumption of red wine is associated with a lower risk of dementia. There is compelling evidence that caloric restriction can improve overall health by activating a class of enzymes known as Sirtuins. Resveratrol is a substance found in some plants that directly activates sirtuins, mimicking the effects of caloric restriction and may affect regulatory pathways of diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In this study, people with AD will be given either Resveratrol or placebo for 12 months to determine whether daily resveratrol therapy is beneficial in delaying or altering the deterioration of memory and daily functioning. Subjects age 50 and above with a diagnosis of probable AD may qualify for participation in this study. A small group of 15 participants will be asked to take part in a more detailed 24-hour Pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study that will measure resveratrol levels over a 24 hour period.","757 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States",2015-09-30,2015-11-26,,,26,2015-03-30 01:33:09.59716,2015-03-30 01:33:09.59716,,imoscar@ucla.com,Dr. Oscar Bluth,t,-118.4457428,34.0661172

34,A Pilot Trial of Interferon Beta-1a in Alzheimer's Disease (REAL),"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment resulting from neuronal loss. The primary pathological feature of the disease is the extracellular deposition of fibrillary amyloid and its compaction into senile plaques. The senile plaque is the focus of a complex cellular reaction involving the activation of both microglia and astrocytes adjacent to the amyloid plaque. In fact, microglias are the most abundant and prominent cellular components associated with these plaques. Plaque-associated microglia exhibits a reactive or activated phenotype. Through the acquisition of a reactive phenotype, microglia responds to various stimuli, as is evident by the increased expression of numerous cell-surface molecules, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II antigens and complement receptors.
Traditionally, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been considered a ""demyelinating"" disease. Recent immunocytochemical studies suggest that MS may be more than a demyelinating disorder, and that even in early stages of the disease, MS pathological scenario envisages axonal damage. Interferons, the modern therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MS, are cytokines - proteins which lead to a network of signals within different cells. In the immune system, IFNs act at different levels. For example, IFNs increase the expression of MHC class II antigens and, thereby, facilitate the antigen-presenting process and the activation of lymphocytes. T-lymphocytes are important targets of IFN immunomodulation. In MS, it is believed that IFN beta suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, and increases the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10. Since the activation of microglia and astrocytes is common to both AD and MS, IFN beta could have therapeutic applications in the treatment of AD. Furthermore, recent studies have also found that through astrocyte production, IFNs promote the activation of nerve-growth factor.","757 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States",2015-10-28,2015-12-24,,,26,2015-03-30 01:37:19.581226,2015-03-30 01:37:19.581226,,imoscar@ucla.com,Dr. Oscar Bluth,t,-118.4457428,34.0661172
35,Study of the Safety & Efficacy of Leukine® in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Preliminary preclinical results demonstrated that GM-CSF (Leukine®/Sargramostim) rapidly reduced cerebral amyloid deposition and completely reversed memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF in humans, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cognition study of human patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation for cancer and who garner cognitive impairments from the chemotherapy or irradiation. In the patients that received a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to stimulate the bone marrow and recover immune system function, we found that those who received GM-CSF (Leukine®/Sargramostim) plus G-CSF (Filigrastim) significantly improved in cognitive function as compared to those who received G-CSF alone. These findings combined with over two decades of accrued safety data using recombinant human GM-CSF, Leukine®/Sargramostim, in elderly leukopenic patients, suggested that Leukine® should be tested as a treatment to reverse cerebral amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.","757 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States",2015-10-28,2016-01-28,,,26,2015-03-30 01:39:13.859657,2015-03-30 01:39:13.859657,,imoscar@ucla.com,Dr. Oscar Bluth,t,-118.4457428,34.0661172

38,Preliminary Efficacy and Safety Study of ST101 in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurological illness. It produces changes in the brain that include loss of cells and accumulation of abnormal protein deposits. Initial symptoms are cognitive, with deficiencies in short-term memory the most common symptom. As the disease progresses so does the severity of cognitive deficiency. Loss of speech and immobility occur in the terminal stages There is no cure for AD and no marketed treatment that modifies the underlying disease process. Available therapies improve some symptoms of AD by increasing brain concentrations of molecules involved in cognition. ST101 differs from marketed therapies in that it has demonstrated two actions in animal research testing. It improves cognition and it also reduces the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the brain. These two properties suggest that ST101 may be a promising agent for the treatment of AD. This study is designed as a preliminary dose exploration/proof-of-concept investigation of the ability of ST101 to improve cognition during 12 weeks of administration.","170 Manning Drive, Chapel Hill, NC, United States",2015-11-25,2016-02-24,,,66,2015-03-30 01:46:46.98698,2015-03-30 01:46:46.98698,,dhewitt@unc.com,Dr. Dave Hewitt,t,-79.0498218,35.9026439

41,"Literacy-Adapted Psychosocial Treatments for Chronic Pain --- ""Learning About Mastering/My Pain"" (LAMP)","Chronic pain is a significant public health problem that affects over 116 million Americans, costs $600 billion annually, and is unequally borne by people in low-income brackets, especially ethnic minorities. Many individuals also have health literacy deficits (difficulty understanding their illness and difficulty navigating the health care system for treatment) putting them at a greater disadvantage. Treatment usually relies on expensive medical interventions that often have negative side-effects. Psychosocial treatments, like Pain Education and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), show promise, but are usually unavailable. Clinicians are poorly equipped to provide psychosocial treatments to patients with low health literacy. CBT has not been adapted and supported for use in individuals with low health literacy, and even educational materials are often poorly adapted for their needs.
To address this problem, the PI completed a small trial showing benefits from health literacy-adapted pain education and CBT groups for chronic pain in a population with low income and low health literacy. Patients in both treatments reported lower pain by the end of treatment, and the effects were maintained at one year. Patients in the CBT group also reported less depression. The current study uses a larger sample, and directly compares these psychosocial treatments to medical treatment-as-usual to seek better evidence for or against their widespread use in community settings.
Our research questions:
In people with chronic pain and low income and/or low literacy, does participating in a health-literacy-adapted psychosocial treatment improve their pain and interference in daily activities due to pain by the end of treatment when compared with a group receiving typical medical care, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?
Does participation in the CBT pain management group improve symptoms of depression better than a pain education group by the end of treatment, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?
In partnership with a federally qualified health center, we will enroll 294 patients with chronic pain. Main outcomes will be patient-reported pain intensity, pain interference, depression, and perceived change. From an earlier trial, we expect that our participants will be ~75% female and ~70% African American, and will have low literacy and low income (~60% in the low 15% nationally on word reading, and 90% at or below the poverty threshold).","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2015-10-14,2016-01-27,,,40,2015-03-30 01:58:48.965554,2015-03-30 01:58:48.965554,,drhouse@duke.com,Dr. Gregory House,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528

44,QTc and Perceived Sleep Follow up Among Chronic Pain Patients With Opiate Medication,"Since the reports of three deaths attributed to Torsade de Point (TdP) related to treatment with the long-acting methadone derivative levomethadyl acetate HCl (LAAM), methadone has been scrutinized for any possible association with TdP. Since then, several studies among Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) patients and chronic pain patients were done, reporting diverse results about possible association between methadone dose and QTc prolongation. Most studies however were cross-sectional and generally found insignificant clinical prolongation of QTc. A follow up studies are of importance, and although few studies have started evaluating QTc among MMT patients, none was done among chronic pain patients with no history of drug usage. One study of 8 chronic pain patients experiencing insufficient pain control or intolerable side effects during treatment with oral morphine switched to oral methadone showed insignificant modest increase QTc following 9 month.
Perceived Sleep:
Chronic pain patients as well as drug addicts are known to suffer from poor sleep. Some studies found possible relation to methadone dose, however, no causal association was found and importantly some also found association with duration of opiate usage before starting methadone when entry to MMT clinic. Thus, patients with no history of opiate addiction are an important interesting group that may help understand relation between methadone usage and sleep quality. However, sleep must be evaluate before opiate administration and a follow up study is needed","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2015-10-01,2015-11-25,,,40,2015-03-30 02:12:31.151916,2015-03-30 02:12:31.151916,,drhouse@duke.com,Dr. Gregory House,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528
45,Lidocaine Infusion for Chronic Pain in Opioid Dependent Patients,"Prescription drug abuse represents a major healthcare problem, with treatment costs reaching billions of dollars annually in the United States alone. Today opioids are commonly prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain and are only partially effective for short-term pain relief. Whereas opioids are initially part of the solution for pain, it eventually often turns to be a problem in patient with chronic pain. Long-term treatment with opioids can be complicated by development of tolerance, dependency, addiction, abnormal pain sensitivity, hormonal changes, and immune modulation. Unfortunately, the chronic use of anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a marked increase in adverse effects.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether systemic administration of lidocaine provides effective pain relief in opioid dependent chronic pain patients. Investigators intend to demonstrate that lidocaine infusion can improve pain relief and physical function in opioid dependent patients, thus improving compliance and patient satisfaction, which may potentially help wean patients off narcotics. The long-term goal of this proposal is to decrease opioid dependence in chronic pain patients by using lidocaine infusion.","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2015-07-22,2015-11-18,,,40,2015-03-30 02:14:43.980806,2015-03-30 02:14:43.980806,,drhouse@duke.com,Dr. Gregory House,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528
48,Web-Based CBT for Children With Chronic Pain,"Chronic pain is an important problem for children and adolescents owing to its high prevalence rate and significant impact on children's mood, daily functioning, and overall quality of life. Effective psychological treatments have been developed to change behaviors and thoughts important in the child's ability to cope with chronic pain. However, the majority of children do not have access to these treatments due to a variety of barriers such as geographical distance from pediatric pain treatment centers.
The purpose of this study is to develop a more accessible method of delivering effective psychological treatment to reduce pain and increase function in children. Children with chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain will be randomized to either receive the web-based treatment right away or to be in a wait-list control condition and receive the treatment 8 weeks later. Both groups of children will continue to receive clinical care through specialty medical clinics.

50,rTMS for the Treatment of Chronic Pain in GW1 Veterans,"A number of studies have been conducted on the health of veterans deployed to Iraq during GW1. The focus of these studies has been primarily to define the nature of symptoms and symptom clusters and to determine if evidence supports the definition of a new unique illness. Most noteworthy is the ""Iowa Study"", a cross-sectional study of 3,695 veterans from Iowa consisting of those who were and were not deployed in GW1. In telephone interviews the Gulf War deployed veterans reported approximately twice the number of symptoms compared to those who were not deployed.
The often ambiguous and seemingly treatment resistant symptoms presented by GW1 veterans represent a challenge to the Veteran's Affairs Health Care System on two fronts; efficacy in treatment and cost. In particular, unlike most medical conditions which can be diagnosed by objective medical findings, pain is a subjective experience (International Association for the Study of Pain, 1994). Therefore the investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial of rTMS in chronic pain that occurs in the context of multiple medical symptoms in the GW1 population. The symptom category approach will be applied with the restriction that enrolled GWI diagnosed patients will have symptoms of chronic pain as outlined in the musculoskeletal category and at least two additional symptoms.","170 Manning Drive, Chapel Hill, NC, United States",2015-12-02,2015-12-30,,,67,2015-03-30 02:24:29.143708,2015-03-30 02:24:29.143708,,lcuddy@unc.com,Dr. Lisa Cuddy,t,-79.0498218,35.9026439

54,Perioperative Ketorolac-lidocaine in the Patients With Valvular Heart Diseases During Cesarean Delivery,"Rheumatic heart valve diseases are prevalent among the young people in Egypt secondary to the socioeconomic conditions. The goal of anesthetic management of these patients is maintenance of sinus rhythm, systemic blood pressure, preload, coronary perfusion, and cardiac output. Many women still prefer general anesthesia rather than regional techniques at the author's country.
The pharmacological modifications of the sympathetic response to tracheal intubation and surgical stimulation using opioids have adverse effects on the neonatal outcome after cesarean delivery. The authors have demonstrated in their previous studies the safety of both perioperative infusion of both of ketorolac and lidocaine in the attenuation of the hemodynamic and hormonal responses of tracheal intubation and surgery during cesarean delivery with favorable neonatal outcome and without added risk of perioperative bleeding. Therefore, the authors reported successful anesthetic management of a parturient with infective endocarditis on top of rheumatic mitral valve disease with use of paracetamol-lidocaine-ketorolac-propofol anesthesia.
The investigators hypothesize that the perioperative use of ketorolac-lidocaine would reduce the maternal hemodynamic responses to intubation and surgery without any harmful effects on mother or baby during uncomplicated cesarean delivery in the parturients with valvular hear diseases.
The investigators are aiming to compare the effects of ketorolac-lidocaine and fentanyl on surgical stress responses, intraoperative fentanyl and vasoactive drugs consumption and neonatal outcome during cesarean delivery in the parturients with valvular hear diseases.","1211 Medical Center Drive, Nashville, TN, United States",2015-08-12,2015-11-05,,,92,2015-03-30 02:36:59.808217,2015-03-30 02:36:59.808217,,harpo@vanderbilt.com,Dr. Harper Mixer,t,-86.8017829,36.1413237

The MTD is the highest dose level in which <2 patients of 6 develop a first cycle DLT. New dose levels may begin accrual only if all patients at the current dose level have been observed for a minimum of 3 weeks after the last infusion of Terameprocol (EM-1421). The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be the MTD unless significant clinical activity is seen below the MTD.
During the observation period of 3 weeks, additional accrual to a previously assessed lower dose level, with no documented DLTs, will be allowed with sponsor approval.
Patients will be treated three times a week, with at least one day in between infusions, for two weeks followed by one week of rest. The dose for new cohorts will be escalated from 1000, to 1500 and 2200 mg or de-escalated to 500 mg if 1000 mg exceeds the MTD. The principal investigator will consult with the sponsor to determine the appropriate dose level for a new patient. At the MTD, up to 10 additional patients may be accrued in that dose cohort to further define the toxicities and response of the agent. If the initial dose level exceeds the MTD, a fallback dose level of 500 mg will be implemented.
Patients are allowed to be treated with subsequent cycles of Terameprocol (EM-1421) until disease progression or until severe toxicities occur and side effects do not outweigh the benefit of study drug administration in the assessment of the treating physician.
Intrapatient dose escalation Intrapatient dose escalation by one dose level may be permitted, but only if at least 3 patients in the next higher dose level have been treated and have been followed for 21 days without experiencing DLT. Decisions for intrapatient dose escalation will be made jointly by the Study Sponsor, treating physician and Principal Investigator.

63,Effect of Cyclosporine Therapy on Gene Expression in Patients With Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia,"Background:
LGL leukemia is a low grade non-Hodgkins Lymphoma characterized by tissue invasion of the marrow, spleen and liver
Recurrent infections due to chronic neutropenia and transfusion-dependent anemia are the principal causes for initiation of therapy
Approximately 50% of patients treated with cyclosporine (CSA) respond to treatment. CSA appears to correct the associated cytopenia without decreasing LGL numbers, suggesting it may inhibit LGL secretion of yet unidentified mediators of neutropenia and anemia.
Analysis of differential gene expression profiles in patients with LGL leukemia treated with cyclosporine has the potential to detect as yet unidentified, therapeutic targets and possibly provide predictors of CSA responsiveness.
Objective:
Identify changes in gene expression patterns induced by cyclosporine therapy in patients with LGL leukemia
Identify differences between responding and non-responding patients
Eligibility:
-Patients with Large Granular Lymphocyte leukemia
Design:
Patients will be treated with cyclosporine at a dose of 5-10mg/kg/day in divided doses, with doses adjusted to maintain a therapeutic serum level between 200-400ng/ml. These therapeutic levels shall be maintained for 3 months.
Tumor response will be evaluated after 3 months therapy, the dose of CsA may then be tapered to that required to sustain a response or discontinued if no evidence of response, or after relapse.
Blood sampling or Lymphapheresis for collection of circulating malignant cells will be performed at a number of different time points. Gene expression profiling will be carried out on Affymetrix microarrays to compare pretreatment and post-treatment samples.","757 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA, United States",2015-08-13,2015-12-31,,1,24,2015-03-30 02:55:43.926915,2015-03-30 03:02:30.933543,,cole@ucla.com,Dr. Colter Mixer,t,-118.4457428,34.0661172

In adults, eczema commonly localizes to the hands or feet. Several studies have implicated bacterial contamination, especially with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), to be a factor in atopic dermatitis, as infection with this bacteria correlates with disease severity. No trial to date has investigated how to treat S. aureus infection in adults with hand or hand/foot dermatitis. Using retapamulin ointment in the nose and on the hands or hands/feet, the investigators expect to have a significant clearance rate of s. aureus infection.

The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study is to capture and characterize occult arrhythmias which occur in hemodialysis patients over a 6 month period. After informed consent and baseline assessment, 30 adult hemodialysis patients without a prior history of cardiac arrhythmias will undergo implantation of a continuous cardiac monitoring device (REVEAL, Medtronic). Three followup visits will be scheduled to download device data and quantify the number of potentially malignant arrhythmias which occur in study subjects during the 6 month period. Additionally, captured events will be monitored remotely via regular patient initiated transmission of device data every 2 weeks. Any serious occult arrhythmias detected will be immediately acted upon with a predefined management algorithm. Descriptive data and simple proportions will be used to describe the incidence and types of arrhythmias among the study cohort. Risks of this study include 1) potential loss of patient confidentiality 2) risks related to insertion of device including pocket hematoma, device infection, pain and discomfort secondary to procedure. These will be minimized by strict security measures to protect each patient's protected health information (PHI), preprocedural screening and insertion of monitoring devices by highly trained operators, and frequent careful direct patient followup.","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2015-10-14,2015-10-16,,,43,2015-03-30 03:36:00.334857,2015-03-30 03:36:00.334857,,khart@duke.com,Dr. Kevin Hart,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528

Investigators planned this study for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of wet cupping and an Iranian traditional medicine preparation, SERKANGABIN in treatment of migraine headache compared with current medicine protocols. SERKANGABIN is a preparation of honey, vinegar and distilled mint water that in traditional Iranian medicine is believed to have therapeutic effects in many diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive airway disease, interstitial lung disease, hepatitis, fatty liver, ischemic heart disease, migraine, cerebrovascular diseases)","170 Manning Drive, Chapel Hill, NC, United States",2015-10-21,2016-01-15,,,65,2015-03-30 03:45:38.027402,2015-03-30 03:45:38.027402,,bbwolf@unc.com,Dr. Bigby Wolf,t,-79.0498218,35.9026439
88,Electrical Stimulation of the Sphenopalatine Ganglion for the Treatment of Migraine Headaches,"This investigation will gather information about a procedure called sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation, and its appropriateness, safety, and efficacy as a treatment for those who suffer migraine headaches which may result in chronic severe disability. The SPG is a small collection of nerve cells in the head, and is located near the base of the nose on either side. Participation involves the surgical implantation of an electrode (small electrical conductor) over the sphenopalatine ganglion. The electrode is connected to a stimulator which will enable treatment for migraine headaches. Tiny electrical current is delivered to the stimulator device by an internal pulse generator implanted in the area at the top of the chest, to stop the migraine headaches. The implant system will be controlled with a wireless remote provided after the implant procedure.
Participation will record headache diaries throughout the study, which will last approximately 8½ months, and a yearly visit annually for five years.","170 Manning Drive, Chapel Hill, NC, United States",2015-07-09,2015-10-30,,,65,2015-03-30 03:47:05.984225,2015-03-30 03:47:05.984225,,bbwolf@unc.com,Dr. Bigby Wolf,t,-79.0498218,35.9026439

The intervention delivered to both study arms will be identical except for the addition of the ACT component delivered in the ACT-ME condition, thereby allowing an estimate of the specific additive effect of the psychotherapy. Measures of acceptance and behavioral avoidance, theoretically important mechanisms of change, will be used to test intervention components by examining whether these processes are uniquely affected by the ACT-ME intervention and whether they account for observed treatment effects. The central hypothesis is that the ACT-ME treatment will lead to significantly greater reduction in depression (HRSD) and disability (WHO-DAS, WHOQOL, and HDI) at follow-up compared to the MEO treatment. ACT-ME participants also are expected to demonstrate reductions in behavioral avoidance and enhanced acceptance, which mediate treatment effects.

92,"MIBRAIN - Migraine and the Brain: Consequences, Causes, and Vascular Interaction","Migraine is a very common, chronic/intermittent and disabling neurovascular headache disorder that has long believed to have no severe consequences. Recent evidence, however, strongly suggest that migraine is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and there is initial evidence that migraine is associated with structural brain changes independent of the occurrence of stroke.
As migraine has strong links with the vascular system, it is plausible that vascular functions interact on the association between migraine and structural brain changes as well as cognition.
Our primary objectives are to investigate: (i) the relationship of migraine and migraine subtypes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in a cohort of patients with active migraine; (ii) the relationship of migraine on cognitive performance among patients with active migraine; and (iii) the relationship of migraine and migraine specifics with vascular functions and morbidity. As secondary objective, we investigate whether the association of migraine on structural brain changes or cognitive performance is modified by vascular functions.
This will be an observational study conducted in the Headache Center in Bordeaux. 300 patients have to be included (150 patients with migraine with aura and 150 patients with migraine without aura).
Inclusion criteria are: all patients with a clearly defined migraine (as per IHS[International Headache Classification] criteria) who are aged 30 and older, are able to fluently speak French, and who are willing to participate.
Exclusion criteria are: pregnant woman and patient who have a major psychiatric disease or major anxiety disorder or had a pacemaker (which would not allow to perform a MRI imaging).
The cognitive status in the patient cohort will be ascertained by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). In addition to the RBANS, we will use the HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test) and MIDAS (MIgraine Disability ASessment) and the depression scale CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale).
Vascular risk status will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure and reports of vascular risk factors. The endothelial function will be measured with a noninvasive Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT) signal technology using the EndoPAT device (Itamar Medical Inc, Framingham, MA).
For crude comparisons, chi-square tests will be used for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Multivariable-multinominal modeling techniques will be utilized for the comparisons adjusting for potential confounding variables. All statistical tests will be two-tailed and a P <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.","1211 Medical Center Drive, Nashville, TN, United States",2015-08-13,2015-10-23,,,96,2015-03-30 03:54:07.103724,2015-03-30 03:54:07.103724,,gogol@vanderbilt.com,Dr. Jhumpa Lahiri,t,-86.8017829,36.1413237
94,Migraine--Investigational Treatment of Migraine With Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. (tDCS- Migraine),"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a painless and noninvasive procedure called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can be an effective therapy for the treatment of migraine and migraine-associated pain.
Stimulation of the motor cortex with tDCS has already been shown to relieve pain in patients with other chronic pain syndromes, including traumatic spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. Patients with migraine are usually extremely sensitive to pain. A treatment that targets the areas of the brain that are related to the experience of pain may also help decrease pain in patients with migraine. Pain control with this localized approach may help avoid the problems due to pain medications that affect all organs in the body.
We hypothesize that 10 sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over the area of the brain that controls pain and motor function will decrease pain and headache frequency in patients with migraine.","1211 Medical Center Drive, Nashville, TN, United States",2015-07-24,2015-09-26,,,96,2015-03-30 03:56:27.222028,2015-03-30 03:56:27.222028,,gogol@vanderbilt.com,Dr. Jhumpa Lahiri,t,-86.8017829,36.1413237

Unfortunately many people with asthma continue to suffer from asthma symptoms that could be control with better asthma care and more attention to details such as triggers, and adherence. To date the only tools available and recommended by groups such as the national asthma guideline group consider only asthma burden and do not include information on the most common factors that adversely affect asthma control. This study provides one half of the enrolled primary care offices with the Asthma APGAR which is a system of patient completed questions and a care flow sheet. The other half of the enrolled practices will continue to provide ""usual"" care without the support of the Asthma APGAR system. The research questions is whether or not asthma control and asthma related quality of life will be improved in people with asthma who are cared for in the intervention practices that use the Asthma APGAR system.","550 1st Avenue, NY, United States",2015-08-07,2015-09-04,,,4,2015-03-30 04:01:20.847081,2015-03-30 04:01:20.847081,,duck@nyu.com,Dr. Donald Dunn,t,-73.9740858,40.7423034

98,Smartphone-facilitated Asthma Control (SNAPP),"The objective of this protocol is to pilot an innovative approach to medication adherence to determine if such an approach will improve inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication adherence, a critical gap in improving the health of children with asthma.
Acute asthma exacerbations occur yearly in almost 60% of children with asthma. They are the most frequent reason for childhood hospitalization and the most expensive component of pediatric asthma care in the U.S. Exacerbations impair quality of life and disproportionately affect African-American children, children with Medicaid insurance, and the poor. Up to 70% of exacerbations are preventable if guideline-recommended inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication adherence is achieved. However, ICS medication adherence in children with persistent asthma is dismal at only 11 - 18%. Amongst children with Medicaid insurance prescribed ICS, 63% discontinue the medication within 90 days. As a healthcare system, investigators have been unable to meaningfully improve ICS medication adherence in a cost-efficient way for patients with asthma, and particularly for the high-risk, highest-potential population of children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. These children suffer the greatest morbidity and mortality from asthma yet have highest-potential to benefit from improved ICS medication adherence. There is an urgent need for an efficacious adherence intervention for this population because, without it, these children will continue to experience impaired health and disproportionate morbidity.
The investigators' long-term objective is to identify and disseminate an intervention that will minimize the occurrence and severity of exacerbations in this population. The overall objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of Smartphone-facilitated medication Notification for Asthma Control in Pediatric Patients (SNAPP) using a wireless medication monitor (WMM) and smartphone application that provides parents reminders for administration of ICS medication, real-time feedback on preventive and controller medication adherence, and wireless upload of this data to a secure online database. The central hypothesis is that for children in this population, SNAPP will result in >=25% improved Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores in comparison with usual management. Secondary hypotheses are that the intervention will result in a >= 30% decrease in FeNO in comparison with usual care at 6 months and >=40% increase in ICS medication adherence at 6 months. The central hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of reports that parents of children with acute exacerbations continue to have insufficient knowledge of asthma self-management yet are motivated to do what is best for their child. SNAPP incorporates monitoring, reminders, and dynamic feedback through a smartphone that will improve ICS medication adherence and that will influence the child's future independence and chronic disease-management skills. Importantly, the investigators will use wireless medication monitors to accurately and objectively ascertain ICS medication adherence without patient effort. Parents are facile with and use wireless technology to organize their daily activities and for communicating. Incorporating this technology into health care and medication adherence is a logical next-step.
The investigators propose to test the hypotheses through the following Aim: To determine whether SNAPP meaningfully improves 6-month asthma control measured with the Asthma Control Test, airway inflammation measured using exhaled nitric oxide and ICS adherence compared with usual care, in an RCT of children with moderate or severe persistent asthma.","550 1st Avenue, NY, United States",2015-08-19,2015-12-25,,1,4,2015-03-30 04:02:44.719469,2015-03-30 04:07:07.272721,,top@nyu.com,Dr. Rocco Prestia,t,-73.9740858,40.7423034

The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of the recruitment goals and also the logistical issues related to use of tele-health technology in developing electronic asthma action plan (eAAP) and communicate with asthma patients in a time period of 24 months. The goals are: 1) enable asthma patients to self-manage their asthma symptoms. The secondary, 2) help care providers to intervene appropriately based on the patient's health status. The secondary objective is to explore the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of the proposed technology. Our research group proposes to complete a feasibility study, with an interim analysis for a formal power calculation and then acquire ethics to report these results and study design with anticipated publication prior to proceeding with a full randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this intervention. The outcome measure will be assessed and data will be presented in a 24-month time frame.
Aims and goals:
The main aim of our proposed study is to assist asthma patients to practice asthma self-management at home that will eventually enable them to control their asthma, and specifically, prevent asthma exacerbation. Therefore, the ultimate goal of our proposed study is to improve patient health outcome via enhancing patient-physician interaction and using a more practical asthma action plan model (eAAP) that could be followed easily by the patient and their doctor.
Our hypothesis is that asthma patients who have access to the electronic online action plan complimented by weekly text messages to reinforce adherence will have a reduced rate of asthma exacerbation. We further hypothesize that these subjects will have an improvement in secondary measures including quality of life, better asthma control and patient satisfaction. We also anticipate that such an approach in asthma management will be cost-effective as outlined below.","550 1st Avenue, NY, United States",2015-08-12,2015-09-24,1,1,4,2015-03-30 03:59:43.225386,2015-03-30 04:07:13.068907,,wootcamp@nyu.com,Dr. Victor Wooten,t,-73.9740858,40.7423034

Subjects agreeing to participate in the study and meeting the eligibility criteria assessed at the screening visit will be enrolled in the study. The length of time between screening and treatment will last between 0 days to a maximum of 12 weeks. Subjects who enter the screening phase during a cluster headache episode and meet the study eligibility criteria can immediately enter the treatment phase and may opt to treat their cluster headache episode in the clinic. Subjects who are not in a cluster headache episode, who meet initial screening eligibility criteria, can remain in the screening phase for up to 12 weeks until their next cluster episode begins. Upon initiation of a cluster headache episode, subjects will enter the treatment period. Subjects will be trained on the proper use of the hand-held dispenser containing carbon dioxide (CO2 )calibrated to deliver 0.5 standard liters per minute (SLPM). This dispenser will be provided for use in the clinic or home. Subjects will be instructed to use the nasal CO2 dispenser, 10 seconds/nostril, as needed up to 6 times to treat one attack. Each dose must be separated by 3-5 minutes. Subjects should treat only one attack in a 24-hour period. Subjects may treat up to three cluster headache attacks during the treatment phase of this study. One hour after the first dose, subjects can choose to treat with investigator-approved rescue medication. Subjects will be asked to complete an online diary after the completion of the dosing. Diary assessments will collect pain severity, nasal CO2 usage, acute medication usage, satisfaction of treatment, number of cluster attacks, and unusual symptoms. Subjects will be contacted by phone within 3 days of the first use of the nasal CO2 dispenser to assess adverse events (AEs) and medication usage.

This cooling effect will cause the blood vessels to constrict and it is thought that this may provide symptomatic relief in both these forms of headache. 10 migraine patients and 5 cluster headache patients will be enrolled in the study and will receive 10 treatments each, for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time. They will be monitored during the treatment and for two hours afterwards to assess headache severity and side effects.

This study seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of the commercially available 4mg StatDose formulation of sumatriptan as an acute treatment of cluster headache. Patients are allowed to use repeated dose of the study medication for a given headache if they have had a partial response to the first dose. They may treat up to 3 attacks of cluster headache with the study medication. Safety assessment will be through adverse event reporting and physical examination.

10,A Pilot Study of Demand Valve Oxygen Inhalation Therapy for Cluster Headache,"Cluster headache is a disorder marked by frequent attacks of short-lasting, severe, unilateral head pain with associated autonomic symptoms. It is the most severe head pain syndrome known. Currently, the two most common treatments for cluster headaches are inhaled oxygen and injectable sumatriptan. These treatments do not work for all cluster headache patients, and patients who smoke may eventually develop contraindication to triptans. New treatment options are needed.
An alternative method of oxygen delivery (as opposed to continuous flow) uses a demand valve that is controlled by respiration rate, allowing increased oxygen flow in response to increased demand. This system may be more efficacious at stopping a cluster headache attack than the currently prescribed oxygen delivery system.
This study will compare the effectiveness of oxygen delivered via demand valve versus continuous high flow oxygen via non-rebreather face mask in the acute treatment of a cluster headache attack. All patients will treat one cluster headache with each of the 2 treatment methods.","1701 Jefferson Street, Baltimore, MD, United States",2016-01-28,2016-02-26,1,31,52,2015-03-30 00:28:10.80492,2015-03-30 12:00:09.694607,,dsimon@johnshopkins.com,Dr. David Simon,t,-76.5939733,39.2962631
61,Lenalidomide in Acute Leukemias and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"Lenalidomide has properties of thalidomide and appears to have some activity against cancer in laboratory tests. Researchers are still learning how lenalidomide works against cancer in patients. Some ways that this drug seems to produce anti-cancer effects include through stimulating the immune system and blocking blood vessels contributing to cancer growth. The current study will explore different dose levels in patients to gather more information about lenalidomide.
Purpose:
This study will assess the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Toxicity or side effects within patients will also be evaluated. Other purposes of this study include analyzing preliminary clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Pharmacokinetics refers to the activity of drugs in the body over a period of time, including how drugs are absorbed, distributed, localized in tissues, and excreted. Pharmacodynamics refers to the bodily processes that lead the drug to effect cancer and other cellular components in the body.
Treatment:
Study participants will be given lenalidomide through intravenous infusions once every 28 days. A 28-day period constitutes a cycle. Since this study will assess the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide, some study participants will receive different amounts of this drug compared to others depending upon when each individual enrolls in the study. Each group of 3 to 6 study participants will receive a higher dose of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated dose is established. Several tests will be performed throughout the study, including bone marrow biopsies. Imaging exams will be conducted as well.

14,Evaluation of Efficacity and Safety of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Chronic and Treatment-Resistant Cluster Headache(CH),"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in chronic and treatment-resistant CH. Inclusion criteria are: patients with chronic CH (>3years), with daily attack and non response to adequate treatment. Electrodes are implanted stereotactically in the postero-inferior hypothalamus. In this crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded study, the efficacy of DBS is evaluated using comparison of two one-month sequences: one with stimulation ""on"" and the other with stimulation ""off"" (placebo sequence). Efficacy is defined as ≥50% decrease of weekly frequency of CH attacks. After the randomized period, long-term efficacy and safety are evaluated after one year of stimulation in open conditions.","1211 Medical Center Drive, Nashville, TN, United States",2016-01-27,2016-04-27,2,32,90,2015-03-30 00:39:42.730469,2015-03-30 12:00:09.700649,,bman@vanderbilt.com,Dr. Aaron Berndston,t,-86.8017829,36.1413237
13,Prophylactic Treatment of Episodic Cluster Headache,"Cluster headache is an unilateral headache with periodic attacks, that usually lasts for 6 to 12 weeks. The pain is usually unbearable. The attacks are treated with injections of sumatriptan (migraine medication)and inhalation of oxygen.
The most common prophylactics today has limited effect and a risk of side effects.
Candesartan has in one study shown a clinically significant effect in migraine prophylaxis.
The angiotensin II receptor blocker, candesartan is well tolerated with side-effects not significantly different from placebo and with few drug interactions. We therefore wish to investigate the prophylactic effect in treatment of cluster in headache patients.
This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study where the prophylactic effect of candesartan is compared to placebo in a period of 3 weeks. First week 16 mg and the following 2 weeks 32 mg.","1211 Medical Center Drive, Nashville, TN, United States",2015-12-31,2016-05-06,,30,90,2015-03-30 00:35:35.442876,2015-03-30 12:00:09.697934,,bman@vanderbilt.com,Dr. Aaron Berndston,t,-86.8017829,36.1413237

2,Civamide Nasal Solution for Cluster Headache (ECH),"This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, phase III efficacy and safety study of civamide nasal solution 0.01% in the prevention of cluster headaches during an episodic cluster headache period. Approximately 180 subjects (about 90 per treatment group),will be enrolled and randomized to double-blind treatment with either civamide nasal solution 0.01% or vehicle solution at approximately 50 study sites with about 2-5 subjects randomized per enrolling site.
This study consists of four periods beginning with a Screening Period, lasting for a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 12 months, during which a subject previously diagnosed with episodic cluster headaches is not experiencing cluster headaches and is awaiting the onset of their next episodic cluster headache period and subsequent enrollment. The Screening Period is followed by a 31-day study, consisting of a 3-day Baseline Period which may begin with the onset of an episodic cluster headache period and ends on the day prior to initiating treatment (Day -1). Subjects return for Visit 2 (Day 1, Pre-Dose) and the Treatment Period begins, consisting of seven (7) days of double-blind treatment. The Treatment Period is immediately followed by a twenty-one (21) day Post-Treatment Observation Period.","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2015-12-30,2016-03-31,4,36,39,2015-03-29 22:42:29.059985,2015-03-30 12:00:09.703032,,jam@duke.com,Dr. Jackson Mixer,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528
3,Botox Injection in Treatment of Cluster Headache,"Cluster headache is an intense and powerful, one-sided headache accompanied by involuntary symptoms such as red eye, droopy eyelids, flow of tears, small pupils and one-sided facial sweating. The headache is believed to be the most intense of all headaches and among many is totally disabling and of great personal and social consequences. For a small group of patients with episodic and most chronic form, drug therapy has little effect. For them, surgery can be a solution.
Neuroradiology has found evidence of a possible original activation of cluster headache from the portion of the brain called hypothalamus. Furthermore, an activation of the parasympathetic nervous system through the sphenopalatine ganglion, which may also explain some of the one-sided involuntary symptoms, is suspected in cluster headache. Injection of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) inhibits secretion of synaptic acetylcholine resulting in nerve signals being blocked. The duration of such a blockade is believed to be 3-9 months.
The purpose of the present study is to develop and evaluate a new surgical procedure with injection of BTA for blocking of the sphenopalatine ganglion. The goal is to relieve the symptoms of refractory cluster headache with a minimal invasive procedure.
The main objective of the project is to determine the safety of BTA injection in the area of the sphenopalatine ganglion of refractory cluster headache and detect the adverse events. Secondary objectives are to identify the changes of headache attacks by the method used.","Duke Regional Hospital, Durham, NC, United States",2016-02-03,2016-07-27,1,36,39,2015-03-29 22:44:35.401319,2015-03-30 12:00:09.706414,,jam@duke.com,Dr. Jackson Mixer,t,-78.9000668,36.0368528
